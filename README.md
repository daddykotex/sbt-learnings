# Learn about sbt

The goal here is to understand how sbt works. That means, if I need to do
something with `sbt`, I must be able to do it in this project and actually
understand how it works.

## Structure

The project will be split on several branches. Each branch contains an sbt
project built specifically to demonstrate something. The branch name shall
be explicit about the nature of the sbt project.
